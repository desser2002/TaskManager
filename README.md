🎯 **Task Manager** isn’t just another to-do list. It’s a minimalist yet powerful console application for managing complex dependencies between tasks and subtasks. Perfect for technical projects where one task blocks the completion of others.

- 🔒 Prevents task completion until all subtasks are marked as done. 
- 📊 Generates reports on overdue tasks and weekly progress.
